# Slope-Field-Visualizer
Authors: Nick Grisanti, Eric Corona

A Python graphing program for slope fields of ODEs.

This is our attempt at a slope field graphing program. We have not yet implemented
trig functions as user input. There are some edge cases we have yet to work out, such 
as slope fields that require raising 0 to a negative power. As it stands, the program 
will output an error if you enter an invalid input.

The file unused.py contains some miscellaneous differentiation functions that were
completely useless for our slope field visualizer. But we kept them there because why 
not?
